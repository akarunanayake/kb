# CollectionBuilder-Sheets

A fork of (the unfinished/incompletely documented) collectionbuilder-sheets...as far as I can see it works just fine.

Uses a googlesheet feed to load data into a website template. 

There may be other ways to do this e.g. explore

* https://dylancastillo.co/build-a-site-quickly-using-google-sheets-python-and-aws/

**Note: this template is not yet fully functional or documented! Check back soon**

CollectionBuilder-Sheets is an experimental project template designed to load collection metadata directly from Google Sheets or other CSV. 
This enables live collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.

To learn more check [docs/sheets-metadata.md](docs/sheets-metadata.md).

This template is based on [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh).
